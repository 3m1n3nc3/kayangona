      title="The problem we solve"
      info="Smallholder farmers in rural communities of Nigeria who forms 70% of Nigeria's labour force are grossly under producing and this is leading to acute food shortage, poverty and hunger. They are grossly under producing at an average of 1.2 tons per hectare when compared to an average of 3-5 tons per hectare of other developing countries, and this is currently leading to acute food shortage, poverty and hunger in the country. The biggest problem causing the low productivity of rural farmers is inadequate use of farm inputs such as quality seeds and fertilizers and the barriers limiting smallholder farmers in Nigeria from using farm inputs adequately are high upfront cost of farm inputs and poor distribution network."

      info="Our service has impacted the live of smallholder farmers in rural communities by saving them from travelling long distances in search of farm inputs, reduce their budget cost by over 25% and help them in timely application of the farm inputs which will increase their harvest yields to over 3 tons per hectare, improve their livelihood and boost their income. Our extension service in the form of a training on Micro-dosing, seed spacing and other farm best practices has ensured that seeds and fertilizer produce maximum yields for farmers. We shall offer these training in clusters at the beginning of every farming season so that what the farmers will learn would still be fresh in their minds towards ensuring effective practical usage of the knowledge theyâ€™ve acquired and this will empower them to increase their productivity, avert unforeseen losses and uplift themselves and households out of poverty and hunger."
